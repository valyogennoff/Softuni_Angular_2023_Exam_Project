# Softuni_Angular_2023_Exam_Project

## A marketplace web app built with Angular, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose, including all CRUD operations

* The app gives users an opportunity to register as a merchant and sell items on the marketplace. They can register as many item as they wish, setting a price, description and photo.
* The project deploys what has been included in the SoftUni Angular Course:
    * Angular CLI
    * Angular components
    * Angular modules
    * Authentication and authorization
    * Guards
    * Directives
    * Interceptors
    * Angular Material
    * Reactive and template-driven forms
    * Storing data in a database (Mongo DB)

* The style of the app is accomplished manually by using HTML and CSS, without the help of Angular Material.
